# LinuxQuickConfig ðŸš€

This repository provides scripts designed to streamline and automate various configurations on Linux systems. From setting up fonts to optimizing your shell experience, LinuxQuickConfig aims to simplify the process and save you time.

## Workflow ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥

LinuxQuickConfig follows a simple workflow to enhance your Linux experience:

1. **Explore the Source Code**: Dive into the `src` directory to discover the scripts available for various tasks.

2. **Run AutoScript**: Execute `AutoScript.py` to initiate automatic installation of essential software packages. This script intelligently detects your package manager (apt or pacman) and installs required packages accordingly.

```bash
python3 AutoScript.py
```

3. **Customize Configurations**: Use `main.py` to execute distribution-specific scripts for additional configurations. These scripts include setting up browsers, fonts, and customizing the Zsh shell.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

4. **Manage Swap Memory**: Optionally, run `swapMemory.sh` to manage swap memory, improving system performance.

```bash
bash swapMemory.sh
```
